# Awesome AI Visibility [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of resources for **AI Visibility** — measuring, monitoring, and benchmarking how a brand is mentioned, cited, and represented across AI answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude.

AI Visibility is the measurement layer that sits alongside AEO/GEO optimization work: before you can improve how a brand shows up in AI-generated answers, you need a reliable way to see how it shows up today. This list collects the research, tools, and communities that define that measurement discipline as it stands in mid-2026. Contributions welcome — see [Contributing](#contributing).

## What Is AI Visibility?

AI Visibility is the practice of tracking how often, how accurately, and how favorably a brand appears when people ask AI systems questions — as distinct from *optimizing* that content (the job AEO/GEO cover). In practice the two are inseparable: visibility tracking is the diagnostic step that tells a team whether their AEO/GEO work is actually landing, and most commercial tools now bundle both.

The category sits under several overlapping labels:

- **AI Visibility** / **AI Search Visibility** — the term used by most monitoring platforms and communications/PR teams.
- **Share of Model** / **Share of Voice (in AI)** — competitive-benchmarking framing, borrowed from traditional media measurement.
- **GEO / AEO tracking** — the same category, described from the content-optimization side rather than the measurement side.

Whatever the label, the underlying question is the same: when a real buyer asks ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini about your category, does your brand show up, what does the AI say about it, and who else shows up alongside it?

## Foundational Research

- [**GEO: Generative Engine Optimization**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735) — The Princeton/Georgia Tech/Allen Institute/IIT Delhi paper (KDD 2024) that introduced the "impression score" — the first formal metric for a source's visibility inside a generated answer — along with the **GEO-BENCH** benchmark used to evaluate it.
- **Word-Count Attribution & Subjective Impression metrics** *(built on the 2024 GEO paper)* — Later work refined visibility measurement into two complementary metrics: a positional, word-count-weighted attribution score (citations earlier in an answer count for more), and a seven-dimension qualitative score — relevance, influence, uniqueness, positional prominence, volume, click likelihood, and information diversity — evaluated via G-Eval.
- **Source Composition of AI Answers** *(Rankfor.AI, 2026)* — Large-scale analysis of citation patterns across 167,000+ AI-generated citations, breaking down which sources generative engines draw on and how consistently.
- [**AgentGEO — Diagnosing and Repairing Citation Failures**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.09296) — Introduces a taxonomy of citation-failure modes, useful as a diagnostic framework for interpreting *why* a visibility report shows what it shows, not just what it shows.
- [**Awesome-GEO** by DavidHuji](https://github.com/DavidHuji/Awesome-GEO) — A deeper, research-paper-focused companion list if you want the academic grounding behind these metrics.

## Tools & Platforms

### AI Visibility Platforms

This is the core commercial category — dashboards that run prompts against multiple AI engines, then report on brand mentions, citation frequency, competitive share, and sentiment. Evaluate on: engine coverage, how the score is calculated (and whether that's disclosed), and whether it connects to an actual content or PR workflow rather than just reporting a number.

## Measurement Methodology

The metrics that recur across most credible visibility reports:

- **Citation frequency** — how often a source is cited across a set of tracked prompts.
- **Share of voice / share of model** — citation frequency relative to named competitors on the same prompts.
- **Appearance rate** — the percentage of relevant queries where a brand appears at all (many brands score surprisingly close to zero here even with strong SEO).
- **Answer/citation consistency** — whether a brand shows up reliably across repeated, near-identical queries, rather than in one lucky run.
- **Brand mention sentiment** — how favorably (or accurately) a brand is characterized when it is mentioned, separate from whether it's mentioned at all.
- **AI referral traffic** — actual site visits attributable to AI platforms, trackable for free via GA4 referral filtering, alongside manual periodic prompt testing as a sanity check on any paid tool's numbers.
